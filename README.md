## Notes & Assumptions

### **Key Features**

- **Add/Delete Tasks** : Simple CRUD operations with animations.
- **Filtering** : Toggle between "All," "Active," and "Completed" tasks.
- **Persistence** : To-Do items are saved to `localStorage`.

### **Technical Choices**

- **TypeScript** : Strict typing for safer state management.
- **Vite** : Faster builds and HMR compared to Create React App.
- **Vanilla CSS** : No CSS frameworks to keep dependencies minimal.

### **Assumptions**

1. Tasks are user-specific (no backend/auth).
2. Mobile responsiveness was prioritized
